## v4.2.1

This version was released on June 21, 2023.

#### Improvements

This version improves the network transmission strategy, enhancing the smoothness of audio interactions.

#### Issues fixed

This version fixed the following issues:

- Inability to join channels caused by SDK's incompatibility with some older versions of AccessToken.
- After the sending end called `setAINSMode` to activate AI noise reduction, occasional echo was observed by the receiving end.
- Brief noise occurred while playing media files using the media player.



## v4.2.0

v4.2.0 was released on May xx, 2023.

#### Compatibility changes

If you use the features mentioned in this section, ensure that you modify the implementation of the relevant features after upgrading the SDK.


**1. Channel media options**

- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` is deleted. Use `publishCustomAudioTrack` instead.
- `publishCustomAudioSourceId` is renamed to `publishCustomAudioTrackId`.

**2. Virtual sound card (macOS)** 

As of v4.2.0, Agora supports third-party virtual sound cards. You can use a third-party virtual sound card as the audio input or output device for the SDK. You can use the `stateChanged` callback to see whether the current input or output device selected by the SDK is a virtual sound card.

<div class="alert note">If you set AgoraALD or Soundflower as the default input or output device when joining a channel, you will not hear audio.</div>

**3. Miscellaneous**

- `onApiCallExecuted` is deleted. Agora recommends getting the results of the API implementation through relevant channels and media callbacks.
- The `IAudioFrameObserver` class is renamed to `IAudioPcmFrameSink`, thus the prototype of the following methods are updated accordingly: 
  - `onFrame`
  - `registerAudioFrameObserver` and `unregisterAudioFrameObserver` in `IMediaPlayer`
- `startChannelMediaRelay`, `updateChannelMediaRelay`, `startChannelMediaRelayEx` and `updateChannelMediaRelayEx` are deprecated. Use `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx` instead.

#### New features

**AI noise reduction**

This release introduces the AI noise reduction function. Once enabled, the SDK automatically detects and reduces background noises. Whether in bustling public venues or real-time competitive arenas that demand lightning-fast responsiveness, this function guarantees optimal audio clarity, providing users with an elevated audio experience. You can enable this function through the newly-introduced `setAINSMode` method and set the noise reduction mode as balance, aggressive or low latency according to your scenarios. 

#### Improvements 

**1. Voice changer**

This release introduces the `setLocalVoiceFormant` method that allows you to adjust the formant ratio to change the timbre of the voice. This method can be used together with the `setLocalVoicePitch` method to adjust the pitch and timbre of voice at the same time, enabling a wider range of voice transformation effects.

**2. Channel media relay**

This release introduces `startOrUpdateChannleMediaRelay` and `startOrUpdateChannleMediaRelayEx`, allowing for a simpler and smoother way to start and update media relay across channels. With these methods, developers can easily start the media relay across channels and update the target channels for media relay with a single method. Additionally, the internal interaction frequency has been optimized, effectively reducing latency in function calls.

**3. Custom audio tracks**

To better meet the needs of custom audio capture scenarios, this release adds `createCustomAudioTrack` and `destroyCustomAudioTrack` for creating and destroying custom audio tracks. Two types of audio tracks are also provided for users to choose from, further improving the flexibility of capturing external audio source:

- Mixable audio track: Supports mixing multiple external audio sources and publishing them to the same channel, suitable for multi-channel audio capture scenarios.
- Direct audio track: Only supports publishing one external audio source to a single channel, suitable for low-latency audio capture scenarios.

#### Issues fixed

This release fixed the following issues:
- When the host frequently switching the user role between broadcaster and audience in a short period of time, the audience members cannot hear the audio of the host.
- The receiver was receiving the low-quality stream originally, and automatically switched to high-quality stream after a few seconds. (macOS)
- Incorrect information in the type field of the return value after calling getDefaultAudioDevice. (macOS)
- Playing audio files with a sample rate of 48 kHz failed.

#### API changes

**Added**

- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelay`
- `startOrUpdateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `getNtpWallTimeInMs`
- `getCurrentMonotonicTimeInMs`
- `setAINSMode`
- `createCustomAudioTrack`
- `destroyCustomAudioTrack`
- `AudioTrackConfig`
- `AudioAinsMode`
- `AudioTrackType`
- The `domainLimit` and `autoRegisterAgoraExtensions` members in `RtcEngineContext`

**Deprecated**

- `startChannelMediaRelay`
- `startChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `updateChannelMediaRelay`
- `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`
- `onChannelMediaRelayEvent`
- `ChannelMediaRelayEvent`

**Deleted**

- `onApiCallExecuted`
- `publishCustomAudioTrackEnableAec` in `ChannelMediaOptions`


## v4.1.0

v4.1.0 was released on December xx, 2022.

#### New features

**1. In-ear monitoring**

This release adds support for in-ear monitoring. You can call `enableInEarMonitoring` to enable the in-ear monitoring function.

To adjust the in-ear monitoring volume, you can call `setInEarMonitoringVolume`.

**2. Local network connection types**

To make it easier for users to know the connection type of the local network at any stage, this release adds the `getNetworkType` method. You can use this method to get the type of network connection in use. The available values are UNKNOWN, DISCONNECTED, LAN, WIFI, 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G. When the local network connection type changes, the SDK triggers the `onNetworkTypeChanged` callback to report the current network connection type.

**3. Audio stream filter**

This release introduces filtering audio streams based on volume. Once this function is enabled, the Agora server ranks all audio streams by volume and transports the three audio streams with the highest volumes to the receivers by default. The number of audio streams to be transported can be adjusted; contact [support@agora.io](mailto:support@agora.io) to adjust this number according to your scenarios.

Agora also supports publishers in choosing whether the audio streams being published are to be filtered based on volume. Streams that are not filtered bypass this filter mechanism and are transported directly to the receivers. In scenarios with a number of publishers, enabling this function helps reduce the bandwidth and device system pressure for the receivers.

<div class="alert info">To enable this function, contact <a href="mailto:support@agora.io/">support@agora.io</a>.</div>

**4. Loopback device (Windows)**

The SDK uses the playback device as the loopback device by default. As of 6.1.0, you can specify a loopback device separately and publish the captured audio to the remote end.

- `setLoopbackDevice`: Specifies the loopback device. If you do not want the current playback device to be the loopback device, you can call this method to specify another device as the loopback device.
- `getLoopbackDevice`: Gets the current loopback device.
- `followSystemLoopbackDevice`: Whether the loopback device follows the default playback device of the system.

**5. Spatial audio effect**

This release adds the following features applicable to spatial audio effect scenarios, which can effectively enhance the user's sense-of-presence experience in virtual interactive scenarios.

- Sound insulation area: You can set a sound insulation area and sound attenuation parameter by calling `setZones`. When the sound source (which can be a user or the media player) and the listener belong to the inside and outside of the sound insulation area, the listener experiences an attenuation effect similar to that of the sound in the real environment when it encounters a building partition. You can also set the sound attenuation parameter for the media player and the user by calling `setPlayerAttenuation` and `setRemoteAudioAttenuation` respectively, and specify whether to use that setting to force an override of the sound attenuation parameter in `setZones`.
- Doppler sound: You can enable Doppler sound by setting the `enable_doppler` parameter in `SpatialAudioParams`. The receiver experiences noticeable tonal changes in the event of a high-speed relative displacement between the source source and receiver (such as in a racing game scenario).
- Headphone equalizer: You can use a preset headphone equalization effect by calling the `setHeadphoneEQPreset` method to improve the audio experience for users with headphones. If you cannot achieve the expected headphone EQ effect after calling `setHeadphoneEQPreset`, you can call `setHeadphoneEQParameters` to adjust the EQ.

**6. MPUDP (MultiPath UDP) (Beta)**

As of this release, the SDK supports MPUDP protocol, which enables you to connect and use multiple paths to maximize the use of channel resources based on the UDP protocol. You can use different physical NICs on both mobile and desktop and aggregate them to effectively combat network jitter and improve transmission quality.

<div class="alert info">To enable this feature, contact <a href="mailto:sales@agora.io">sales@agora.io</a>.</div>

**7. Register extensions (Windows)**

This release adds the `registerExtension` method for registering extensions. When using a third-party extension, you need to call the extension-related APIs in the following order:

```
loadExtensionProvider` -> `registerExtension` -> `setExtensionProviderProperty` -> `enableExtension
```

**8. Device management**

This release adds a series of callbacks to help you better understand the status of your audio devices:

- `onAudioDeviceStateChanged`: Occurs when the status of the audio device changes. 
- `onAudioDeviceVolumeChanged`: Occurs when the volume of an audio device or app changes. 

**9. Multi-channel management**

This release adds a series of multi-channel related methods that you can call to manage audio in multi-channel scenarios.

- The `muteLocalAudioStreamEx` method is used to cancel or resume publishing a local audio stream.
- The `muteAllRemoteAudioStreamsEx` is used to cancel or resume the subscription of all remote users to audio.
- The `startRtmpStreamWithoutTranscodingEx`, `startRtmpStreamWithTranscodingEx`, `updateRtmpTranscodingEx`, and `stopRtmpStreamEx` methods are used to implement Media Push in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `startChannelMediaRelayEx`, `updateChannelMediaRelayEx`, `pauseAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, `resumeAllChannelMediaRelayEx`, and `stopChannelMediaRelayEx` methods are used to relay media streams across channels in multi-channel scenarios.
- The `options` parameter in the `leaveChannelEx` method, which is used to choose whether to stop recording with the microphone when leaving a channel in a multi-channel scenario.


#### Improvements

**1. Relaying media streams across channels**

This release optimizes the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method as follows:

- Before v4.1.0: If the target channel update fails due to internal reasons in the server, the SDK returns the error code `RelayEventPacketUpdateDestChannelRefused (8)`, and you need to call the `updateChannelMediaRelay` method again.
- v4.1.0 and later: If the target channel update fails due to internal server reasons, the SDK retries the update until the target channel update is successful.

**2. Reconstructed AIAEC algorithm**

This release reconstructs the AEC algorithm based on the AI method. Compared with the traditional AEC algorithm, the new algorithm can preserve the complete, clear, and smooth near-end vocals under poor echo-to-signal conditions, significantly improving the system's echo cancellation and dual-talk performance. This gives users a more comfortable call and live-broadcast experience. AIAEC is suitable for conference calls, chats, karaoke, and other scenarios.

**Other improvements**

This release includes the following additional improvements:

- Reduces the latency when pushing external audio sources.
- Improves the performance of echo cancellation when using the `audioScenarioMeeting` scenario.
- Enhances the ability to identify different network protocol stacks and improves the SDK's access capabilities in multiple-operator network scenarios.

#### Issue fixed

This release fixed the following issues:

**All**: The call `getExtensionProperty` failed and returned an empty string.
